# A media archive for the January 8 bolsonarist insurrection in Brazil

Here we have two spreadsheets. The <sub>media_index</sub> one has four columns to it: file title, file type, source link and description. What could be stored in files is at the media folder. The news_article spreadsheet contains links news articles and some other links that I judged interested to understand what happened and the overall landscape of things.

I plan on updating this as more information comes out.
